If you want to create a new arena you need to copy the template number 001 and rename it to the next free number in the row.
For example New_Arena_001.erm to New_Arena_006.erm. Then you need to open the copy and replace with notepad the number "_1_" to "_6_".
Then you edit all parameters and start the game. In the city you can use the GEM town menu to access the arena. 
Dont forget to also change the number 
!!VRi^Arena_1_Fight^:S1; in line 122 to your template number, in case of our example to !!VRi^Arena_1_Fight^:S6;  ,otherwise you arena will not start the battle
