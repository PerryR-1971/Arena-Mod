*Blank Creature Bank Template* 
by Perry R for ERA 3 
created 2020

The idea of this template is that you can create new creature banks (CB) relatively fast by choosing any object and turn it into a scripted CB. You just need to open the erm file and edit the first part of the script and make your settings.
For each new CB, you just copy and place a new ERM file with the name of the creature bank in your mod folder. 
The object (the new CB) can be anything. From a blank object to a Pandora Box (in theory). You just need an object ID. I recommend using the blank WoG Objects because they have no functionality.  
When you want to use object IDs that already have a functionality in-game to turn them into custom CBs, like Dragon Fly Hives, Learning Stones, or Tree of Knowledge, the standard reaction will be disabled and my script takes control. 
Later when fully developed it will emulate a 100% working creature bank like in HotA. Ideally, there will be no visual difference. If this can be achieved I don't know yet.
Depending on your ERM skill this template will of course also allow any possible modification to your creature bank. You can create custom CB texts, fights, special rewards and conditions. I only provided the most basic functions to simulate already existing CBs.

If you want any improvements or find any bugs please report on Heroes Community.
